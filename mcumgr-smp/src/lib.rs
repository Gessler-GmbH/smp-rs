//! A library that implements the SMP protocol.
//!
//! This library aims to be compatible with the Zepyhr SMP implementation.
//! For more information, see <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.1.0/services/device_mgmt/smp_protocol.html>
//!
//! Apart from [smp_framing], messages are encoded and decoded from and to raw byte buffers.
//! You must provide your own transport implementation.
